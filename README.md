This Plugin allows you to repair armour/weapons/tools with the base item needed to craft the item and keep the enchantments.
Costs are depending on the damage of the item, amout of base items needed to craft the item and the level of the enchantments.
To repair an item drop the item and the base item into the workbench.
The result is the repaired item with enchantments.

__No special block or construction needed. Just use the workbench__

Example:
* One iron ingot repairs 1/3 of an iron pickaxe without enchantments.
* One iron ingot repairs 1/9 of an iron pickaxe with a level 3 enchantment.

Base items:
* iron ingot for all iron tools, weapons, armour and shears
* iron ingot for chainmail armour (but cheaper than iron armour)
* leather for leather armour
* cobblestone for stone tools
* wooden planks for wood tools
